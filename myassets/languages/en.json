Being a GNULinux user motivated me to start programming with Unix, later I learned C# for game development and I have recently begun to specialize in brand languages, creation and Web design in both Front-end and Back-end fields.</br>    </br> In Back-end environment, I am familiar with the data base creation, access and modification with MySql and PHP, both remotely and locally with XAMPP. I have also made simple mobile applications with Android Studio and JavaScript.</br> </br>  My intention is to update this page incorporating samples of my current skills and also of the new ones that I'll be acquiring. The Front-end section is made up of 5 videos below, check them out!"
